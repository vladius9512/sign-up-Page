# sign-up-Page

This assignment wants me to create something similar to (or the same as): https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png

I have a chance to exercise my html and css skills some more while starting to create
good-looking pages. 

What have I learned doing this page?

-practice with position attribute (and how to effectively use it)
-play more with the idea that flex is a box inside a box
-practice more with :focus pseudo-class
-if you want to design pages, you kind of need a sketch before (photoshop might come in handy)

In the end, it was fun building this page and even if the pages are not 100% alike, 
is just cause I wanted to experiment with how hard is to "design" yourself a page from almost 0.
